It seemed silly until it compounded. Five years later, they dominated the Olympics. This is the Compound Effect. You don't need a massive overhaul to change your life. Read 5 pages a day. Do 10 pushups. Save $5. Small, boring habits, repeated daily, are the secret to overnight success. Most people overestimate what they can do in a day, but underestimate what they can do in a year.",
